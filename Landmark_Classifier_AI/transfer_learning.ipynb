    "My architecture uses a pre-trained model. I chose resnet18 as it leverages learned features from a large dataset, making it highly effective for transfer learning. By freezing the pre-trained layers,when retraining I reduced training complexity, preventing overfitting. The final fully connected layer was modified to match the specific number of target classes (50), giving the model a chance to adapt to the current issue. This approach balances complexity and computational efficiency, ensuring robust performance for the image classification task.\n",
